# HDAT 9700 Term 3 2019 Assessment 1A

## Assessment 1A - Chapters 1 and 2 Marks and Feedback

## Specific comments 
1) You provide explanations on the matching variables,  and nice justifications on which variables we shouldn’t be using in the matching process. However, you include baby’s gender and gestational age as pre-treatment matching variables, but these aren’t pre-treatment variables. Furthermore, low gestational age could be a consequence of smoking during pregnancy, so it should not be matched on. 
2) Your matching code is correct, expect for the inclusion of the pre-treatment variables. You need to expand on your answers a bit, it’s not sufficient to state the statistics without interpreting them. 
3) code all correct
4)   The estimated effect of smoking decreases between the raw data model and the matched data model because some of the difference in birthweight between babies of smokers and non-smokers is attributable to other background characteristics, which are associated with smoking and birthweight. Matching on pre-treatment variables makes it a fairer comparison, so the apparent effect of smoking diminishes. Matching increases the likelihood of the exchangeability assumption being true, making us more confident that the effect we see is a causal effect.
5) Nice answer Alex 
6) Good understanding of the key concepts here Alex. You note that you won’t match for gestational period, which you can’t anyway, because this is determined at the time of the outcome, not at the time of treatment. In a sufficiently large RCT, we’d expect balance between smokers and non-smokers. However if we saw the imbalance in the data, as we see in this exercise, we’d want do either match on these confounders, or adjust for them in some way in the model, to relieve some of the bias which they would cause. Stratification is another way we can analyse the data, but in the presence of multiple confounders we’d opt to either match or adjust for these variables.
